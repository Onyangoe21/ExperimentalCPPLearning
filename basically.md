If you explained all the concepts here to a 4 year old, could it get any simpler than this:

### function:
Think of a function like a magic button. When you press it, it does a bunch of things for you at once. Like a "walk" button that makes you move your left leg and right leg without thinking about each step. Functions make things easy by doing a bunch of steps all at once!

#### overloading:
Basically, overloading can be seen as a step to make a function do more things: are the value types passed to the function restricting you? -- overload the function, are you restricted by the order of parameters? -- overload, or is it simply the number of parameters? --overload.
