// In this file, we will for a second assume that the standard library is the  
//only thing with header files as we have seen it is too complicated:

// So let's go ahead bring in our iostream friend:
/*

Before we dive into the code, let’s get organized and declare all the functions we’re going to write in this file. I mean, who 
wouldn’t want their `main` function to be front and center, right? It’s like putting the star of the show on stage first and 
letting the supporting cast do their thing behind the scenes -- we are all humans before we write code and we love organization.

So, here’s the plan: we’ll make all the necessary declarations up top because there are only 2 options, put them before main or 
declare them and write them in lower sections. By declaring them first, we can keep things tidy, introduce you to the concept and 
let the `main` function shine in the spotlight, while all the nitty-gritty details hang out below, where only the most curious 
will bother to look. 

It’s a feature of C++ that lets us keep things looking neat and clean—because, let’s face it, who can blame anyone for wanting
to tuck away the complex stuff down in the lower sections where no one’s likely to scroll? It’s all about that peaceful, 
organized code life!
