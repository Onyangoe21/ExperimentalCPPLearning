# Function Overloading in C++

_Last Updated: 15 Jul, 2024_

Function overloading is a feature of object-oriented programming where two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters. When a function name is overloaded with different jobs, it is called Function Overloading. In Function Overloading, the function name should be the same, but the arguments should be different. Function overloading can be considered an example of the polymorphism feature in C++.

- **Function Overloading**: If multiple functions have the same name but different parameters, this is known as Function Overloading. 
- **Readability**: Having the same name for the functions increases the readability of the program, especially when performing similar operations with different data types or numbers of arguments.

### Instances of overloading
1. To use Different Parameter Types -- see overloading param_type demonstration:
2. Overloading to add different/ extra parameters: see overloading num_param types:
3. Overloading to change the order of parameters in a function: see overloading_param_order:
