Remember how we hinted to a very short process in code generation that starts with preprocessing --> generation of assembly code ---> generation of machine code ----> linking the binaries: well, turns out there is even more under the hood:

The C++ compiler goes through several stages to transform your source code into an executable program. Here is a summary of the typical order of events during the compilation process:

### 1. **Preprocessing**
   - **Macro Expansion**: The preprocessor expands all macros defined with `#define`.
   - **File Inclusion**: The contents of header files included with `#include` are inserted into the source file.
   - **Conditional Compilation**: Preprocessor directives like `#if`, `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#else`, `#elif`, and `#endif` are processed, and sections of code may be included or excluded based on the conditions.
   - **Line Control**: Directives like `#line` adjust line numbers and filenames for error messages.
   - **Removal of Comments**: All comments in the code are removed.

   **Output**: A single, large source file where all the directives have been expanded.

### 2. **Lexical Analysis**
   - **Tokenization**: The preprocessed source code is broken down into tokens, which are the smallest units of meaning (keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, etc.).
   - **Symbol Table Generation**: The compiler starts building a symbol table that holds information about variables, functions, objects, etc., in the program.

### 3. **Syntax Analysis (Parsing)**
   - **Grammar Check**: The sequence of tokens is checked against the grammar rules of C++ to ensure the code is syntactically correct.
   - **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Construction**: The compiler constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST), which is a hierarchical representation of the program structure.

### 4. **Semantic Analysis**
   - **Type Checking**: The compiler checks that the types of variables and expressions are consistent with their usage.
   - **Template Instantiation**: If the code uses templates, the compiler performs template instantiation here. It expands the template into concrete code for each type itâ€™s instantiated with. During this process, the compiler checks that the template is used correctly and that the types are appropriate.
   - **Scope Resolution**: The compiler ensures that identifiers (variables, functions, classes) are used within their correct scope.
   - **Static Checks**: Various other checks are performed, such as ensuring that functions are called with the correct number of arguments and that variables are initialized before use.

### 5. **Intermediate Code Generation**
   - **Intermediate Representation (IR)**: The compiler translates the AST into an intermediate representation, which is a lower-level code that is easier to optimize but still not specific to the target machine architecture.
   - **Optimization**: The compiler performs optimizations on the intermediate code to improve performance, such as eliminating redundant calculations or reordering instructions.

### 6. **Code Generation**
   - **Assembly Code Generation**: The intermediate code is translated into assembly language specific to the target CPU architecture.
   - **Further Optimization**: The compiler may perform additional, target-specific optimizations at this stage.

### 7. **Assembly**
   - **Machine Code Generation**: The assembler translates the assembly code into machine code, which is a binary representation of the program that the CPU can execute.
   - **Object File Creation**: The machine code is stored in an object file (`.o` or `.obj`), along with additional information needed for linking.

### 8. **Linking**
   - **Symbol Resolution**: The linker resolves symbols (functions and variables) across multiple object files and libraries.
   - **Relocation**: The linker adjusts addresses in the machine code so that all parts of the program fit together in memory.
   - **Executable Creation**: The linker combines all the object files and any needed libraries into a single executable file. This is the final binary that can be run on the target system.

### 9. **Loading (When the Program is Run)**
   - **Loading into Memory**: When the program is executed, the operating system loads the executable file into memory.
   - **Dynamic Linking**: If the program uses shared libraries (e.g., DLLs or `.so` files), the OS loads these libraries into memory and links them with the program.
   - **Execution Start**: The program starts executing, beginning at the `main()` function or a custom entry point if specified.
